# Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you should have the following available to you:

On the kubernetes environment:

    The kubectl command-line tool, configured to connect to your cluster. You can read more about installing and configuring kubectl in the official Kubernetes documentation.
    The git command-line utility. You can learn how to install git in Getting Started with Git.

Check the Velero compatibility matrix:

    Velero compatibility matrix
    Validate the version of kubernetes with the velero versión and aws plugin

## Step 1 — Installing the Velero Client

The Velero backup tool consists of a client installed on your local computer and a server that runs in your Kubernetes cluster. To begin, we’ll install the local Velero client.

In your web browser, navigate to the Velero GitHub repo releases page, find the release corresponding to your OS and system architecture, and copy the link address.

Then, from the command line on your local computer, navigate to the temporary /tmp directory and cd into it:

    cd /tmp

Use wget and the link you copied earlier to download the release tarball:

    wget https://link_copied_from_release_page

Once the download completes, extract the tarball using tar (note the filename may differ depending on the release version and your OS):

    tar -xvzf velero-v1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz

The /tmp directory should now contain the extracted velero-v1.2.0-linux-amd64 directory as well as the tarball you just downloaded.

Verify that you can run the velero client by executing the binary:

    ./velero-v1.2.0-linux-amd64/velero help
